A PHP 7+ library intended to provide spec-compliant CORS middleware for projects running on [Amp's http-server](https://amphp.org/http-server/). 
Though this library lives under the Labrador namespace it has only one dependency, `amphp/http-server`, and does not depend 
on any other Labrador packages.
